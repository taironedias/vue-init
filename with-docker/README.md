This is the latest vue-cli 3 docker image based on latest nodejs.

Clone the repo and use docker-compose to set things up. Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omegacoleman/vue-cli-docker
cd vue-cli-docker
docker-compose up

```
and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to enjoy the latest scaffold of the amazing vuejs ecosystem!

If you wish to build the image yourself instead of using mine, rename "docker-compose.yml.build" and replace "docker-compose.yml", and run ```docker-compose up```.
